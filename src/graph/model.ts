/**
 * The evidence graph: how the PR was made, as nodes and relationships, built from
 * the same redacted evidence as the digest plus the submitted patch.
 *
 * The digest lists facts; the graph connects them. A prompt is linked to the
 * edits made in its turn, an edit to the diff hunks its lines survive in, a run
 * to the files edited after it, a commit to the session that made it. Agents ask
 * it questions with `tracetoon query` ("why did src/x.ts change?", "which
 * behavior files were never checked after their last edit?") instead of
 * reading every fact, and Tracetoon derives per-file provenance, run scope and
 * fact relevance from it for the digest, the notes and the review packet.
 *
 * Every string in it comes from the redacted digest or the patch the agents
 * already receive; it holds no raw transcript text and no line contents.
